# EvoWave Dynamic Lab

**Project Overview**:
EvoWave Dynamic Lab is a web-based RF filter design and analysis tool for engineers, students, and hobbyists. It provides a user-friendly interface to calculate and visualize Bode plots (magnitude and phase responses) for low-pass filters, such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, and OTA-based designs. The project demonstrates skills in React, Chart.js, Flask, and RF engineering principles.

**Features**:
- Interactive Bode plot visualization (magnitude and phase).
- Toggle between magnitude and phase responses.
- Realistic filter responses for RF applications.
- Dark/orange theme for a professional look.
- Export options for plots and data.

**Technologies Used**:
- Frontend: React, Chart.js, styled-components
- Backend: Flask, Python, SciPy
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

**Status**: In progress – currently developing core functionality and planning enhancements.

**Future Enhancements**:
- Add support for high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters.
- Implement zoom/pan interactivity and preset filter configurations.
- Create a desktop version using Electron.
